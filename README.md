# Scope and the fat arrow function

## Intro

- UI5 cannot innovate as much as other frameworks because it needs to remain fully backwards compatible
- Design desicions such as the custom module system vs something like webpack or jsm 
- WebIDE uses strict linting rules. It'll prevent deployment and enforces style, but it also 
prevents the use of ES6+ features
- Many topics to choose from!
  - Webpack/Babel/ESLint: Modern dev pipeline for increased understanding of the build tools and WebIDE
  - Promises and async/await
  - Generator functions
  - Default parameters in functions
  - Template literals, and object literals
  - Destructuring objects and arrays, and the spread operator

## First, a very quick history. 

- Javascript is based on ECMAScript, which is a spec. Browser developers are using it to build the interpreters
- ES5 is from 2009, which we're using now
- ES6 aka ES2015 since 2015, and a new release more or less every year

## Today's session

I chose the concept of context, the keywords const/let, the fat arrow function, and how this can be used in a 
terse, testable functional programming style 

## What is 'this'?
